<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Download the zip file from the link above and extract to any directory. The application can be run directly and does not need any extra installation.</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<h3>Adding a player</h3>

<p>To add a player use the buttons at the top of the screen to select a color and then click on the play area where you want to place the new player.</p>

<h3>Moving a player</h3>

<p>When hovering over various elements in the application (including players) you'll see that the mouse cursor changes to a hand. When this icon appears you can move the element by dragging it in the application.</p>

<h3>Deleting a player</h3>

<p>To delete a player right click and select "Remove Player"</p>

<h3>Editing player speed</h3>

<p>Occasionally you may want one player to be moving slower or faster than everyone else on the screen. To achieve this right click on the player and choose "Set player speed".
This is a slider which affects the speed of the player. Select the appropriate value and click ok (or cancel to exit the dialog without changing speed).</p>

<h2>Cuts</h2>

<h3>Drawing a new cut</h3>

<p>If you hover over any given player (who is not holding the disc) then you'll see a tooltip indicating that you should use ctrl + click to draw a cut.

To do this, hold ctrl and drag from the player to the location where the first part of the cut should end. Each section of a cut must be a straight line but a cut can be made of multiple sections.
Add another section to the cut by hovering over the end of the cut and using ctrl + click to draw the next segment in the same way.

<h3>Moving cuts</h3>

Only the change of direction points on a cut can be moved. To do this hover over the end of the cut and you'll see the mouse cursor change to a hand indicating that you can move that item.
Drag and drop it where you want the end of the cut to be.

<h3>Removing cuts</h3>

There are two ways to remove cuts:

<ol>
<li>Right click on the player who is cutting and choose "Clear cuts"</li>
<li>Right click somewhere on the cut and choose either "Clear cuts" to remove all cuts for that player or "Clear from here" to remove this cut segment and all following it</li>
</ol>

<h2>Triggers</h2>

<p>It is possible to set a frame up so that a player moves when another player reaches a certain point along their cut. This allows
for much more complex plays.</p>

<h3>Creating a trigger</h3>

<p>Right click on the player who you want to start cutting second and choose "Add Trigger". Move the mouse to another players cut and 
you'll see that a dashed circle appears on the cut. This is the point at which the original player will start moving. Click to place the trigger.</p>

<h3>Moving a trigger</h3>

<p>Triggers can be moved in the normal way by dragging them. They can only be placed on cuts of players who are not the one being triggered so the 
icon will track these cuts.</p>

<h3>Deleting a trigger</h3>

<p>To remove a trigger you have two options:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Right click on the player who is going to run second and choose "Clear Trigger"</li>
    <li>Right click on the trigger itself and choose "Clear Trigger"</li>
</ol>

<h2>Disc Flight</h2>

<h3>Giving the disc to a player</h3>

<p>To give the disc to a player click the disc icon in the toolbar at the top of the screen (note that since you can only have one disc per frame the icon disappears)
and click on the player you want to hold the disc.</p>

<h3>Removing the disc from the scene</h3>

<p>Right click on the player with the disc and choose "Remove Disc". This will return the disc to the top toolbar.</p>

<h3>Throwing to a cut</h3>

<p>Hover over the player with the disc and you'll see a tooltip saying "Shift + Click to draw flight path". If you hold shift and drag to 
the end of a cut then the disc will be thrown there.</p>

<h3>Throwing to the floor</h3>

<p>As for throwing to a cut except that if you don't drag to the end of a cut then you can throw to that point on the pitch. If you
do this then the disc will be thrown at the start of the frame.</p>

<h3>Curved flight path</h3>

<p>Once you've created a disc path to either a cut or the floor then you'll notice a small white box halfway along the flight path.
If you drag this to somewhere else on the pitch then you'll see the flight path change to a curve.</p>

<h3>Moving the disc multiple times</h2>

<p>In most plays the disc will need to move more than once. In this application that is achieved using separate frames for each disc movement (see next section).</p>

<h2>Frames</h2>

<p>Each frame in Playbook consists of multiple player movements and a single disc movement. New frames are required whenever you need to 
move the disc more than once.</p>

<p>Frames in playbook are linked together so that a player in frame 2 will start at the end of their movement in frame 1. You can remove this 
linking if required (see below).</p>

<h3>Creating a new frame</h3>

<p>To create a new frame right click in the frames box at the bottom of the screen and choose "New Frame". Each player fromk the previous frame will 
appear in the new frame at the end of their cut from the previous frame.</p>

<h3>Reseting the frame</h3>

<p>It is possible to reset a frame by right clicking on it and choosing "Reset Frame". This will remove all players, cuts 
and the disc leaving you with a blank slate.</p>

<h3>Deleting a frame</h3>

<p>You can delete a frame by right clicking on it in the frame panel (bottom of the screen) and choosing "Delete Frame". If this frame is between 
two other frames then they will not be linked when this one is deleted.</p>

<h3>Unlinking frames</h3>

<p>If you need players to start at a different location in frame B from their ending location in frame A then you can "unlink" the frames by 
clicking on the lock icon between the two frames.</p>

<h3>Relinking frames</h3>

<p>If you need to relink two frames then you can click on the blank lock icon between the frames. This will ask you which frame to use as the master.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Left</strong> - If you choose the left frame as master then the starting position of all players on the second frame will be modified to 
match their ending positions on the first frame.</li>
    <li><strong>Right</strong> - If you choose the right frame as master then the ending position of all players on the first frame will be modified to
match their starting positions on the second frame.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Video</h2>

<p>One of the key features of Playbook is the ability to create high quality videos which can be sent to teammates or uploaded to youtube.</p>

<p>Creating a video is a simple as going to the File menu and selecting "Save as video". This will prompt you to choose a filename and will then 
convert your play into a video returning to the application when it has finished.</p>
